## Shiny App Components

* UI: what our app looks like
    * contains our input and output widgets
    * users can change values in this section

<br>

* Server: what our app does
    * contains reactive logic
    * connects the reactive logic to our input and output widgets
    
## Reactivity

* 2 states of reactives
    1. Their value (numerical, text, plot)
    2. Their validity (valid or invalid)

<br>

* 3 types of reactives
    1. Inputs (outward connections)
    2. Observers (inward connections)
    3. Conductors (inward and outward connections)
    
## Reactives vs. Observers

**Reactives**: calculate or cache a value, meant to be used as a variable, has a result

**Observers**: for side effects--runs some code when a dependency changes, doesn't yield a result, isn't used as input for other expressions, not assigned to a variable (e.g., updating a menu based on a selection)
