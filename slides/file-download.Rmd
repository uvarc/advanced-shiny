## The `downloadButton` widget

* Opens file browser to choose filename and write directory
* Connects to `downloadHandler()` in our server function

## `downloadHandler()`

* 2 arguments: `filename` and `content`
* `filename` can be a name or a function containing paste, etc for generating a name
* `content` is a function containing commands for writing the file

## Dynamic Reports

We can use RMarkdown to generate reports from the results in our Shiny app.

What we need:

* A template .Rmd file
* A `downloadHandler()` with a `content` function containing:
    * `params`: a list of input values we want to use in our .Rmd file
    * `rmarkdown::render()` to render our report
    * some stuff with `tempdir` (this is to prevent issues with write permissions, which users might not have on the deployment server)
